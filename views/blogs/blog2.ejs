        <h2>Step 1: Collection and Sorting</h2>
        <p>The process begins at collection points such as electronic stores, municipal drop-off centers, or certified e-waste recycling partners. Smartphones are sorted by type, brand, and condition to determine whether theyâ€™ll be refurbished, reused, or dismantled for recycling.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Data Destruction</h2>
        <p>Before recycling, all data must be permanently erased. Certified recyclers use industrial-grade software or physically destroy memory chips to ensure no personal data remains on the device. This step builds trust and encourages more users to recycle old phones safely.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Disassembly and Component Recovery</h2>
        <p>Skilled workers or automated systems disassemble smartphones to extract usable components. Batteries, screens, cameras, and circuit boards are separated. Valuable metals like gold, silver, copper, and palladium are carefully recovered using specialized techniques.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Responsible Material Processing</h2>
        <p>Recovered materials are cleaned, sorted, and sent to manufacturers for reuse in new products. Non-recyclable or hazardous materials are disposed of in compliance with environmental regulations to prevent pollution or harm to human health.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Your Phone's Afterlife Matters</h2>
        <p>Every recycled smartphone contributes to a healthier planet and a more circular economy. The next time you upgrade your device, consider its afterlife. Proper recycling ensures precious materials are reused, waste is minimized, and environmental damage is reduced.</p>
